# Flutter's Amazing!

This is my entry to the Flutter Create contest.

## Description

Inspired by Jamis Buck's excellent book
[Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers),
and the beauty, speed, and fun of writing apps with Flutter, I decided
to play around with colors, lines, animations, curves, and custom painters
in Flutter to make some mazes. This app is the result.

## Running the app

For either Android or iOS, execute the following command to run the app:

```
flutter run --release
```
